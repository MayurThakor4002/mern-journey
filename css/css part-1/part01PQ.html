    <!-- poem  -->
    <p>I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
        who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
        Stand in the desert. ... Near them, on the sand, <br>
        Half sunk a shettered visage lies frown, <br>
        And wrinked lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>
        Tell what its sculptor well those passion read <br>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things; <br>
        The hand that mocked them,and the heart that fed; <br>
        My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, king of kings;<br>
    </p>
